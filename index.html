            This data set contains information about the starting and ending location and time of users of the Zagster bike service. 
            The distances of each bike ride is calculated using the starting and ending latitudes and longitudes. 
            This is assuming that each rider went in a straight line from their starting location to their destination. 
            The speeds of each bike ride is calculated using the starting and ending times. 
            The average distance, time, and speed are the averages of all of the valid bike rides obtained in the origional data set. 
            The chart displays the average speed of every user sorted by their average speed from slowest to fastest.
